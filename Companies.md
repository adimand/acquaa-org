The _Companies_ module caters to companies that need to administer their users and assets in a centralised fashion.

This includes 
- ensuring contact and employee information is up-to-date
- managing assets like test kits
- performing actions on behalf of their inspectors/plumbers

**NOTE:** If the plumber is part of a company, any of the company's admins can act on their behalf. Further approval is not required.
